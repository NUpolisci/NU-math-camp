# Day 3

To recap the information that was covered today, feel free to visit the [slides here](day-3-slides.pdf). 

This [problem set](pset2.pdf) will cover summation, limits and continuity of functions, set theory, and some review of matrix algebra. 

Please submit the problem set as a knitted pdf *and* the raw code .Rmd as *two* seperate files, just as they are included here as two separate files. Do this via a file commit to your cloned math camp repository. 

Here is the .Rmd file that you can work with:
