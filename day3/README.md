# Day 3

To recap the information that was covered today, feel free to visit the [slides here](/slides/day3-am.pdf). 

This [problem set](/problem-sets/pset2.pdf) will cover summation, limits and continuity of functions, set theory, and some review of matrix algebra. It is due at the beginning of class on Day 5. 

Please submit the problem set as a knitted pdf *and* the raw code .Rmd as *two* seperate files, just as they are included here as two separate files. Do this via a file commit to your cloned math camp repository. 

Here is the .Rmd file that you can work with:
