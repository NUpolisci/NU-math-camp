# Day 7

To recap the information that was covered today, feel free to visit the [slides here](/slides/day7-am.pdf). 

This [problem set](/problem-sets/pset3.pdf) will cover foundations of integral calculus. It will be due at the beginning of class on Day 7. 

This problem set requires a bit more work by hand, please show your work on another sheet of paper or printed problem set and submit the file as a scanned pdf (there are phone apps) or a pictured converted to .pdf. You will still commit your scanned document to your cloned math camp repository. 

Here is the .Rmd file that you can work with:
