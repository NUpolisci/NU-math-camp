# Day 4

To recap the information that was covered today, feel free to visit the [slides here](/slides/day4-am.pdf). 

This [problem set](/problem-sets/pset2.pdf) will cover summation, limits and continuity of functions, set theory, and some review of matrix algebra. It is due at the beginning of class on Day 5. 

As mentioned on Day 1, please submit the problem set as a knitted pdf *and* the raw code .Rmd as *two* seperate files, just as they are included here as two separate files. Do this via a file commit to the Github classroom in assignment 1. Create a new file in the repository called "Assignment Submissions" as your TA will show you in class. Plan to do this on each of the following assignments in the course. When you include the commit comments, include how much time the assignment took you. As we go along, we'll ask you to include more narrative as to how each assignment went. 

Here is the .Rmd file that you can work with:
