# Northwestern University Political Science Math Camp
This is the repository for the Political Science math camp at Northwestern University. It contains all the relevant tools and links to the content and get through the allotted two weeks.

In this repository there is a page for each day of work, resources both related to and unrelated to this course, and supplementary material that we feel will either provide more background for those newer to quantitative material *or* more challenging material for those that have already had prior exposure to quantitative methods. We will go over this in person to make sure that you don't have any issues. 

Each succesive days' materials will be housed in the following links:
