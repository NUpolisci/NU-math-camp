# Northwestern University Political Science Math Camp
This is the repository for the Political Science math camp at Northwestern University. It contains all the relevant tools and links to survive during the allotted two weeks.

In this repository there is a branch for each day of work, a checklist related to the tasks for each day, and supplementary material that we feel will either provide more background for those newer to quantitative material *or* more challenging material for those that have already had prior exposure to quantitative methods. 

Each day has an accompanying checklist for those participating in the Math Camp activities. Please ensure that at the end of each working day that you are checking to make sure that you have completed all required tasks as continuing success in Math Camp, and the later coursework, will require that you are completing each of these day-to-day tasks. To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your own Git. 

Each succesive days' materials will be housed in the following links:
