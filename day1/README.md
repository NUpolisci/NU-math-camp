# Day 1

To recap the information that was covered today, feel free to visit the [slides here](day-1-slides.pdf). 

This [problem set](NU-math-camp/problem-sets/pset1.pdf) will assess your skills that we will cover over the next two days, algebraic expressions, and a few logical statements. It will be due at the beginning of class start on Day 3. 

Please submit the problem set as a knitted pdf *and* the raw code .Rmd as *two* seperate files, just as they are included here as two separate files. Do this via a file commit to your cloned math camp repository. Plan to do this on each of the following assignments in the course. When you include the commit comments, include how much time the assignment took you. As we go along, we'll ask you to include more narrative as to how each assignment went. 

Here is the .Rmd file that you can work with:
