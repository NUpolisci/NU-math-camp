# ANES: American National Election Studies 
The [ANES](https://electionstudies.org/) collects high quality public opinion and electoral behavior data. Data is available from collection dates from 1948 to 2020. In its most recent 2020 iteration, the ANES conducted a joint study with the General Social Survey [(GSS)](https://gss.norc.org/). 

Given that the data are on public opinion and political behavior, data are at the individual level and cover the following topics: 

1. Demographic Characteristic (including social and religious elements)
2. Partisan Affiliation and Evaluations
3. Ideology
4. Public Opinion on Policy-Related Issues 
5. Support for Political System 
6. Civic Engagement 
7. Evaluation of Electoral Candidates 
8. Voting Choices across Levels of Government 

**How are data collected?**

*Generalized based on the ANES 2016 Metholodology Report. The methodology employed in 2020 was altered due to difficulties of in-person surveys as a result of Covid-19, thus differs from previous years.*

Data are collected across a sample of U.S. eligible voters across two waves, one pre-election and one post-election. Specific details on the sample composition are located on the study pages for each data collection year. In recent years, respondents may participate via different modalities, either online or in-person. For both in-person and online modes, the sampling frame is composed of lists of mailing addresses. Participant eligibility was on the basis of confirmation of their residential status at the sampled address and that they were a U.S. citizen 18+ at the time of their recruitment. 

*In-Person Modality* 	The sampling for face-to-face surveys followed a multi-stage stratified cluster sample across 60 counties or combinations of counties in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Counties were stratified by Census region, poverty levels, prevalence of minority groups, population size, and then selected randomly with probabilities proportion to their citizen adult population. Upon selection of each county primary sampling unit (PSU), secondary sampling units (SSU) were composed of 4 smaller Census Block Group areas. From these SSUs, households were selected at random with USPS delivery sequence files. Interviewees were provided with cash compensation for their interview. 

*Internet Modality* Respondents were randomly drawn from the delivery sequence files of USPS that included addresses in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Each address had equal probability of selection. These addresses received invitations o participate with information on completing the survey online and information on compensation related to participation. Upon visiting the invitation link online, potential participants completed a screening instrument to select randomly a U.S. citizen at the chosen address to complete the ANES questionnaire. 

Weights are provided by ANES to accurately represent estimates of the U.S. voting eligible population. 

The ANES site provides interactive resources for searching through the data and the questionnaires that were fielded over various years. Data are available for download by year or as a cumulative time-series panel.
