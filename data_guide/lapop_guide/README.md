# AmericasBarometer and LAPOP
[LAPOP or the Latin American Public Opinion Project](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/) is a research institution that carries out AmericasBarometer, a cross-sectional, multi-country public opinion study organized by Vanderbilt University. AmericasBarometer covers 34 nations in total across North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean. Much like the cognate public opinion studies carried out in the U.S., [AmericasBarometer](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/about-americasbarometer.php) facilitates a common questionnaire in each of the countries, as well as specific modules that are designed for specific country contexts. For example, the survey in Colombia may ask questions about opinions related to conflict and violence; the survey in Mexico may ask questions about bribery of officials belonging to certain institutions that don't necessarily make sense in other places. As it is a public opinion dataset, observations are at the individual level and the study specifically targets samples of voting-age adults. Topics of interest in the survey include, but are not limited to: 

1. Economy 
2. Rule of law 
3. State capacity 
4. Trust in institutions 
5. Individual values 
6. Corruption 
7. Security 

AmericasBarometer has been fielded since 2004, and conducts rounds every year or so in the primary countries of the study's interest. 

**How are the data collected?**

AmericasBarometer conducts a nationally representative, stratified and multi-stage probability survey in each of the countries in the study. This sampling design was implemented first in 2012 and has been employed in iterations since, with some modifications to accommodate stability and population changes. The stratification design accounts for region, municipality size, and urban and rural areas in the municipality. In every country except Canada and the U.S., the survey is face-to-face and the survey is conducted in all major languages used in the country. In each country therer are ~1,500 individuals sampled. 

As mentioned, the sample is stratified based on size, urban versus rural settlements, and region. Upon selecting settlements in the strata, respondents are selected from each household chosen. The person chosen from each households is based on the permanent residents present, that fit the age and gender requirements of the quota matching implemented in the fielding of the survey. If two or more people were present of the same age and sex, then the questionnaire was carried out with the person whose birthday was closest to  the fielding date. In some countries where the survey is carried out, oversampling of certain populations does occur as a strategy of the survey and this information is available in the methodological reports of that specific survey year. 

Much like other cross-sectional panel surveys, LAPOP has interactive data features that allow you to engage with data before download. The [reports](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/publications.php) page outlines some of the documents that have been produced as a results of data analyses incorporating data from survey rounds.
