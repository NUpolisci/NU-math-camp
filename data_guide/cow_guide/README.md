# Correlates of War (COW) 
The [Correlates of War data project](https://correlatesofwar.org/history) is a project first started by David Singer in 1963 that sought to obtain systematic infromation about war and associated phenomena. Now having gone through several iterations and gathering data to form different types of datasets, COW is one of the most comprehensive data projects on interstate war available for comparative politics and international relations scholars. 

Data in this project compose a handful of different datasets: 
1. State system membership 
2. COW War Data, 1816-2007 
3. Militarized Interstate Disputes 
4. National Material Capabilities 
5. Militarized Interstate Dispute Locations
6. World Religion Data 
7. Formal Alliances 
8. Direct Contiugity 
9. Territorial Change 
10. Colonial/Dependency Contiguity 
11. Intergovernmental Organizations 
12. Defense Cooperation Agreement Dataset 
13. Diplomatic Exchange 
14. Trade

Each of these datasets relies on the use of the COW Country Codes data, which assigns specific codes and abbreviations to each country in the dataset. The unit of analysis will depend on which dataset you are working with. 

These data are hosted by different scholars of these subjects across a number of academic institutions. These hosts are responsible for the revising, updating, and documentation of the datasets over time. 

For similar datasets, COW has released a useful [list](https://correlatesofwar.org/external-links) of other datasets on related topics.
