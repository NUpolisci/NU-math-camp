# Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED)

The [ACLED Project](https://acleddata.com/about-acled/) is a large scale data collection effort that gathers data on dates, actors, places, fatalities, and types of political violence and/or protest events across the world. Data are available from every world region and updated every week. Years of coverage vary across countries, some countries have data as far back as 1997 but others have only been included in data collection efforts.

While data are available in the bulk total, there are also curated datasets that are aggregated or covering different themes. Some of these curated data include: 
1. Regional data 
2. Aggregated data by theme (e.g., total number of civilian fatalities from direct targeting for a country/year)
3. Special projects (e.g., Covid-19 Disorder Events)
4. Actor-Specific data related to different events involving peacekeeprs, media, health workers, etc. 

Due to the data curation, the units of analysis might change in these curated datasets. However, ACLED data are usually observed and recorded given the event date.

Just like other major data projects, ACLED has an [interactive data dashboard](https://acleddata.com/dashboard/#/dashboard) that allows users to visualize and engage with data before download. Some [recent analyses](https://acleddata.com/analysis/) are published on their site that use ACLED data. 

**How are these data collected?** 

Given that ACLED data has to do with violence or protest events, information on these events have to be carefully sourced. Every week, researchers at ACLED comb through 4 types of sources to gather potential data to include in the database. These four sources are media outlets, reports from international and non-governmental organizations, local partners, and new media such as social feeds or messaging platforms.  Given the difficulties of sourcing these data across many contexts, strategies are developed at the regional or national level to deal with the realities of local data compilation in those contexts. In fact, local sources are given priority in data that they generate over potentially traditional sources of data collection-- such as traditional media. In addition to the sourcing practices, ACLED also implements ongoing quality control processes. Specifically, there are source controls, continued sourcing of new sources, corrections, and anonymization that each contribute to the quality control of ACLED data. More information on the methodology of the ACLED data generation and coding process is found on their [website](https://acleddata.com/resources/#methodology). Of particular importance is how they define and then code events into the database.
