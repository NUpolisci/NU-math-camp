# Calculus 

- This is often where we get a lot of nervous faces in the room. But, I can assure you that we are going to stick together in this and everyone will come out knowing some minimal calculus stuff to get you through these quant methods courses. 

# What is calculus? 

>- So basically, calculus is the study of *instantaneous change of a function*. 

*Well, what does that mean?* 

>- On the one hand, we could be interested in *discrete* change. Discrete change tells us the difference between two points on a graph, thus the difference between two observations modeled by a function. 

>- Finding discrete change means finding the slope of two points, or the *secant.* You all are probably familiar with $rise \over run$ from algebra. 

# What is calculus? 

>- But, finding the secant has a limitation. Discrete change only tells about the functional behavior *over an interval*. Instead we might want to find the rate of change at a *very specific moment* in the function. 

>- Consequently, we might also want to find extrema (min and max) of a function, any other critical points, or understand its shape. As you may remember from other courses, these are difficult tasks with merely a function $f(x)$. 

>- Calculus gives us some tools to calculate instantaneous change and other downstream quantities.  

# Limits, Secants, and Capturing Change 

> - In our last session we went over limits of functions. As a reminder, the limit of a function $f(x)$ at a given point $x$ is the value of the function as it approaches the given $x$. 

>- Therefore, to capture discrete change we calculate the secant between two points by taking the difference of the functional limits, i.e. $f(x_2)- f(x_1)\over x_2-x_1$. 

# Limits, Secants, and Capturing Change 

>- To capture the instantaneous or continuous rate of change of a function, we *could* take the difference of the limits over iterations, making the interval between each $x$ smaller and smaller.

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

>- However, the concept of **tangents**, and consequentially **derivatives**, makes this easier. 

# Tangents and Derivatives 

>- While a secant is a slope of a given line, a *tangent* is a line that touches the function at a given point. The tangent's slope tell us about the slope of the primary function, or the instantaneous rate of change, *at that particular point*. 

>- Therefore, the problem becomes *how to find the tangent's slope*. 

# Notation 

>- There are a couple of ways to notate derivatives, all meaning the same thing. 

$f'(x)$ \uncover<2->{Read: "f prime of x"}

$dy \over dx$ \uncover<2->{Read: "dy-dx" or "dy over dx"}

\pause 

>- There also possibilities for **higher order derivatives**, i.e. derivatives of derivatives and so on...

>- Higher order derivatives will use the same types of notation, with details to indicate the order of the derivative 

  >- $f''(x)$ or $d^2y\over dx^2$ for a second derivative; $f'''(x)$ or $d^3y\over dx^3$ for a third derivative

# Calculating a Derivative

To calculate the derivative, begin with the secant formula. Use this formula to reduce the difference to some arbitrarily small value, \(h\). 

As h goes to zero, we go from discrete to instantaneous change. 

Secant Formula: \[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} \] 


# Example: Calculating the Derivative of $f(x)=3x$ 

Secant Formula: \[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} \] 

Example: \(3x\) 

\[
\uncover<2->{  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3(x+h)-3x}{h} }
\uncover<3->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3x+3h-3x}{h}}  
\uncover<4->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3h}{h} } 
\uncover<5->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} 3} 
\uncover<6->{ = 3} 
\]


# Example: Calculating the Derivative of $f(x)=2x$ 



Secant Formula: \[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} \] 

Example: \(2x\) 

\[
\uncover<2->{  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2(x+h)-2x}{h} }
\uncover<3->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2x+2h-2x}{h}}  
\uncover<4->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2h}{h} } 
\uncover<5->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} 2} 
\uncover<6->{ = 2} 
\]

# Example: Calculating the Derivative of $f(x)=x^2$ 

Secant Formula: \[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} \] 

Example: \(x^2\) 

\[
\uncover<2->{  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h} }
\uncover<3->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^2+2xh+2h^2-x^2}{h}}  
\uncover<4->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh+2h^2}{h} } \]
\[
\uncover<5->{ = \lim_{h \to 0} 2x+2h} 
\uncover<6->{=2x+0=2x}  
\]

# So... what does it all mean? 

>- Derivatives give us information regarding the rate of change of given function at a value $x$, we can use this information to learn more about the base function at that particular point. 

>- Think back to what the slope of a linear equation tells us from the formula $y=mx+b$. 

>- If $m$ is positive, the slope is increasing; if $m$ is negative, the slope is decreasing. 

>- The derivative gives us information that we interpret similarly. 


# Derivative as information: Rate of change

>- Positive Derivative \uncover<2->{\color{green}  Function is increasing}

>- Negative Derivative \uncover<3->{ \color{green}  Function is decreasing}

>- Zeroes? \uncover<4->{ \color{green} max or min}

# Derivatives and Extrema

**Extrema**: max or min of a function, i.e. where is the topmost or bottomost of the function?

# Worst Behavior

As we saw before: the function must be \textit{continuous} on the \textit{interval} to be differentiable. 

Some functions are not differentiable *at all* or are not differentiable at *a certain point*. Need to determine the continuity of the function.

# Derivative: Calculation

While we can calculate the derivative using the formula from before, it's a bit tedious. Can't there be another way?

\pause
\vspace{2mm}
Think through the work it would take to differentitate $4x^3+3x-2$ using $\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$...

# Derivative Rules

Take the derivative $f(x)$ as $f'(x)$ below with constant $k$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> $f(k*x)=k*f(x), f'(k*x)=k*f'(x)$
\begin{itemize}

\item<2-> \color{blue} $f(x)=3x$, \uncover<3->{$f'(x)=3$}
\end{itemize}

\item<1-> $f(x)=k$ has derivative $f'(x)=0$
\begin{itemize}
\item<4-> \color{blue}  $f(x)=4$, \uncover<5->{$f'(x)=0$}
\end{itemize}

\item<1-> $f(x)=x^n, f'(x)=n*x^{n-1}$
\begin{itemize}
\item<6->  \color{blue} $f(x)=x^3$, \uncover<7->{$f'(x)= 3x^2$}
\end{itemize}

\item<1-> $[f(x)+g(x)]'=f'(x)+g'(x)$
\begin{itemize}
\item <8->\color{blue}  $f(x)=3x, g(x)=7$, \uncover<9->{$3+0=3$}
\end{itemize}

\item<1-> $[f(x)-g(x)]'=f'(x)-g'(x)$
\begin{itemize}
\item <10-> \color{blue}  $[3x-7]'$, \uncover<11->{$3-0=3$}
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\uncover<12->{\textbf{NOTE: $[f(x)*g(x)]!=f'(x)*g'(x)$} Ex: $(3x*10x)'!=30$}
 
# Derivatives Two Ways

We can check these handy formulas work as they should. Let's try. Find the derivative of $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

>- Formal Definition: $f'(x)=lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$

\uncover<2->{$f'(x)=lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{x+h}-\frac{1}{x}}{h}$}

\uncover<3->{$f'(x)=lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{x}{x(x+h)}-\frac{(x+h)}{x(x+h)}}{h}$}

\uncover<4->{$f'(x)=lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{-h}{x(x+h)}}{h}$}

\uncover<5->{$f'(x)=lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{-1}{x(x+h)}$}

\uncover<6->{$f'(x)=\frac{-1}{x(x+0)}$} 

\uncover<7->{$f'(x)=\frac{-1}{x^2}$}

\uncover<8->{$f'(x)=-x^{-2}$}


# Using the Simpler Rules  

Relevant Rules: $f(x)=x^n, f'(x)=n*x^{n-1}$

\uncover<2->{$f(x)=x^{-1}$}

\uncover<3->{$f'(x)=-1*x^{-2}$}

\uncover<4->{$f'(x)=-x^{-2}$}


# Practice Problems

Find where functions are continuous and find derivatives

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> $f(x)=5$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\(f'(x)=0 \)}

\item<1-> $f(x)=3x-7$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\(f'(x)= 3\)}

\item<1-> $f(x)=3x^2$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\( f'(x)=6x\)}

\item<1-> $f(x)=\frac{x^2}{x}$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\(f'(x)=1 \)}

\item<1-> $f(s)=s^{-2}$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\( f'(s)=-2s^{-3}\) (not continuous at \(s=0\))}

\item<1-> $f(y)=y(y+7)(y-3)$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\(f'(y)=3y^2+8y-21 \)}

\item<1-> $f(z)=\frac{z^2-5z-6}{z+1}$ \uncover<2->{,\color{blue}\(f'(z)=1 \) (not continuous at \(z=-1\))}
\end{itemize}

# Higher Order Derivatives

Second derivatives ($n^{th}$ derivatives): take a derivative a second ($n^{th}$) time

Rate of change of rate of change (velocity vs acceleration)

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> $f(x)=x^5+3x^3+2x+8$
\item<2-> $f'(x)=5x^4+9x^2+2$
\item<3-> $f''(x)=20x^3 + 18x$
\end{itemize}

# Partial Derivatives

Similar to `regular' derivative; treat additional variable(s) as constants. Written as $\partial_x$ or $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x, ...)$ 


\vspace{3mm}
\uncover<2->{Ex: $y=3xz$, $\partial_x=3z$}

\vspace{2mm}
\uncover<2->{Find $\partial_x$ 

$f(x,z)=7xz+4x^2+z$} \uncover<4->{\color{blue}$ \partial_x=7z+8x$}

\uncover<2->{\color{black} $f(x,y)=x+4y$} \uncover<4->{\color{blue} $\partial_x=1$}



# (Additional) Rules for derivatives

So far, we've just had simple functions but what if we are multiplying, dividing, or have an otherwise-more-advanced function? 

- Product Rule: $f(x)*g(x)$

- Quotient Rule: $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$

- Chain Rule: $f(g(x))$ 

- Other: eg, exponentials: $e^x$, $ln(x)$ 

# (Additional) Rules for derivatives

So far, we've just had simple functions but what if we are multiplying, dividing, or have an otherwise-more-advanced function?

- Product Rule: $f(x)*g(x)$, $x^3*x^2$

- Quotient Rule: $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, $\frac{x^4+3x}{x^2}$
 
- Chain Rule: $f(g(x))$, $(x^2+1)^3$ (composition!)

- Other: eg, exponentials: $e^x$, $ln(x)$ 


# Product Rule

If we have two things multiplied together and need the derivative, we have two options: multiply everything and then take the derivative OR use the product rule.
\vspace{2mm}

>- \textbf{Example: (3x+4)(x+2)} 

>- To take the derivative using the product rule, we do the following: $f'(x)*g(x)+g'(x)f(x)$. 

>- For us, our two functions are $f(x)=3x+4$ and $g(x)=x+2$. The derivatives are $f'(x)=3$ and $g'(x)=1$.

>- Then, we substitute these in: $f'(x)*g(x)+g'(x)f(x)=3(x+2)+1(3x+4)$

>- Simplify to get: $3x+6+3x+4=6x+10$. 

\vspace{1mm}


>- To take the derivative using our previous approach, we first multiply: $3x^2+4x+6x+8=3x^2+10x+8$. Then, just take the derivative of each term: $f'(x)=6x+10$. 

# Product Rule: A Motivating Example 

Suppose that instead you had $(3x^2+3x+4)(x^3+2x^2+x+2)$. Now the product rule is looking a little nicer! 

\vspace{2mm}
$f(x)=(3x^2+3x+4)$ and $g(x)=(x^3+2x^2+x+2)$

$f'(x)=6x+3$ and $g'(x)=3x^2+4x+1$.

\vspace{2mm}
We can substitute this into the formula: 

\footnotesize  
$$f'(x)*g(x)+g'(x)f(x)$$

$$\rightarrow (6x+3)(x^3+2x^2+x+2)+(3x^2+4x+1)(3x^2+3x+4)$$.

# Quotient Rule

Example: $\frac{3x^2}{x+2}$.

Formula is $\frac{f'(x)*g(x)-g'(x)f(x)}{(g(x))^2}$

So, we identify the following: $f(x)=3x^2$ and $g(x)=x+2$, therefore $f'(x)=6x$ and $g'(x)=1$.

Plug in to get: 

$$\frac{6x(x+2)-1(3x^2)}{(x+2)^2}=\frac{6x^2+12x-3x^2}{(x+2)^2}=\frac{3x^2+12x}{(x+2)^2}$$

\vspace{2mm}
Practice:  $\frac{x-4}{x+5}$ $\frac{3x^3}{x+2}$

\uncover<2->{\textbf{Ans:$\frac{9}{(x+5)^2}$  \hspace{2mm}  $\frac{6x^3+18x^2}{(x+2)^2}$}}

# Chain Rule 

Sometimes, you have a function to a power: $f(g(x))=(x+3)^3$. We can use the chain rule to evaluate this. 

What we do is we take the derivative of the function and multiply it by the derivative of the inside: $f'(g(x))*g'(x)$. 

So, for our example: $f(x)=x^3$ and $g(x)=(x+3)$. 
\vspace{2mm}

>- The derivative of each is $f'(x)=3x^2$ and $g'(x)=1$.

>- We substitute in to get: $3(x+3)^2*1$. 

# More Chaing Rule 

>- \textbf{Try: } $f(x)=(2x^2+8x)^4$  $f(x)=(9x-x^2)^6$  

>- \textbf{Ans} $4(4x+8)(2x^2+8x)^3$ \hspace{2mm} $6(9-2x)(9x-x^2)^5=(54-12x)(9x-2x^2)^5$

# Exponentials: $e$ and $ln$

You can take the derivative of continuous functions -- including those with a log and/or $e$ in them. The rules are a little hard, but once you learn them, it's not too bad: 

$f(x)=e^x$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=e^x$ (a favorite of mine) 

$f(x)=e^{g(x)}$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=e^{g(x)}*g'(x)$  

$f(x)=a^x$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=a^x(ln(a))$ (used rarely, if ever) 

$f(x)=ln(x)$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ 

$f(x)=ln(g(x))$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=\frac{1}{x}*g'(x)$ 

$f(x)=log_a(x)$ \hspace{2mm} $f'(x)=\frac{1}{xln(a)}$ (rarely used) 

You can make these more complicated by including a function of x. How would we take the derivative in that case? \pause Chain rule!

\textbf{EX: } $ln(3x)$ \pause $f'(x)=\frac{1}{3x}*3=\frac{1}{x}$.  
\pause

\textbf{TRY: $ln(x^2)$, $e^{2x}$} \pause \textbf{ANS: $\frac{2}{x}$ and $2e^{2x}$}


# Derivatives in Review

There are a few more handy rules and techniques that are important, perhaps even on your homework:
