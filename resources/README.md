**Tools to make life easier** 

- [NU Counseling and Pyschological Services](https://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/) is a good place for getting referred out to local therapists and mental health providers. Otherwise, you can browse the [Aetna Provider Finder](https://www.aetna.com/individuals-families/find-a-doctor.html) for a provider that is in-network with your student health insurance.

- [AccessibleNU](https://www.northwestern.edu/accessiblenu/) in case you have needs or requests related to accessibility concerns and accommodations. 

- [Northwestern VPN](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/vpn/) for reliable, secure connections to university pages and resources while away from campus. 

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note management available in Markdown format. Alternatively, others recommend something like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) if you aren't particularly interested in Markdown formatting. 

- [Toggl Time Keeper](https://toggl.com/) is good for keeping tabs on where your time is going. [Centered](https://www.centered.app/download) is an app that is mindful of flow states while working, allowing you to plan your activity, center your work in a flow, and track your activity. The [Pomodoro Timer](https://pomofocus.io/) sets 25 minute time increments, found to be helpful for ensuring bouts of productivity bracketed by short breaks. 

- [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) allows you to block websites that might be distracting or allow you to give in to procrastination. 

- [Trello Project Management](https://trello.com/) helps to plan projects in the long- and short-term, good visualization tool. [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is great for checklists. Both allow you to set deadlines for yourself. 

- [Citation Management](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/research/scholarly/citation-management.html): Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, etc. There are a few different programs, here is a guide to help you decide. Reddit also has some useful threads on the trade-offs between each. 

- [Dataquest](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html): NU offers access to the coursework to a limited number of people on a quarterly basis, just make sure that you get registered in time! 

- [NVivo](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/c.php?g=114906&p=6872685) licenses are available with the department, as some of you will presumably do qualitative work as well. 

- [NU Software Catalog](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/service-catalog/device-management/software/available-software.html) includes all the software that the university provides to students. If there is something you need that is not on this list or only offered at a discounted price, you can also always talk to Department Admin about further options. 

- [NU Library Guides](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/data2) regarding different software packages and how the university can support your learning of these tools. 

- [OneDrive](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/file-sharing/onedrive.html) is the cloud storage of choice for Northwestern. There are degrees of integration you can have with your desktop. If this isn't your favorite interface for remote storage (it's not great), then try Dropbox. 

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) or any other TeX editor for sophisticated document formatting. 

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is good to gauge where your writing is at regarding readability, tone, and other important markers of "good" writing. 

**Things you should do or acquaint yourself with** 

- [Library Workshops](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/visit/events-exhibits/event-calendar.html)

- [Research Computing Services Workshops](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/training.html)

- [Social Science Data Resources at NU](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/c.php?g=114894&p=749250) 

- [Political Science Library Guide](http://libguides.northwestern.edu/politicalscience)

- [Sociology Library Guide](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/sociology) 

- [Proquest Dissertation and Thesis Database](https://www.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/index?_ga=2.185414442.2078620383.1646766670-92380473.1646423938) 

- [Northwestern IRB](https://irb.northwestern.edu/) 

- Transcription Sites: There are too many to list out here. None of them are perfect, but some of them are better than others. I have discussed some of the trade-offs among some programs [here](Transcription_Software_Notes.pdf). 

**Blogs or threads with useful information** 

- [Raul Pacheco-Vega, PhD](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/) this blog has a lot of templates for structuring seemingly nebulous project components.

- [Andrew Gelman's Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) is a widely read methods and current events blog, now including contributors other than Gelman. Some of the entries are commentary on public events, however there are also a lot on methods, causal inference, and computational social science. 

- ["How to Conference"](https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/article-details/6201c6e2cbb4f49a2db95354) by Turner et al. for conference professionalization tips

- [Jessica Calarco's](http://www.jessicacalarco.com/tips-tricks) tips and tricks for grad school and navigating academia. You can also check out her book [*A Field Guide to Grad School* (2020)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691201092/a-field-guide-to-grad-school), also available as an Ebook for around $10. 

**Other tips and tricks** 

- Minimize time spent on daily tasks in and out of grad school that bring you no joy. Find ways to automate things! Meal prep if you hate cooking! Pick out outfits for the week if you hate getting ready for the day! 





<sub> Thanks to all the countless individuals that helped me to compile this list. I have attempted to document most of the suggestions gathered from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmoreorless/status/1501231626243960833) here.</sub>
