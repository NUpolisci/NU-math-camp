**Tools to make life easier** 
[Toggl Time Keeper](https://toggl.com/) 
[Trello Project Management](https://trello.com/)
[Citation Management](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/research/scholarly/citation-management.html): There are a few different programs, here is a guide to help you decide. Reddit also has some useful threads on the trade-offs between each. 


**Blogs or threads with useful information** 
[Raul Pachecho-Vega, PhD](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/) this blog has a lot of templates for structuring seemingly nebulous project components.
[Andrew Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) is a widely read methods and current events blog, now including contributors other than Gelman. Some of the entries are commentary on public events, however there are also a lot on methods, causal inference, and computational social science.
