# Grad School Resources 

**Tools to make life easier** 

- [NU Counseling and Pyschological Services](https://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/) is a good place for getting referred out to local therapists and mental health providers. Otherwise, you can browse the [Aetna Provider Finder](https://www.aetna.com/individuals-families/find-a-doctor.html) for a provider that is in-network with your student health insurance. 

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note management available in Markdown format.

- [Trello Project Management](https://trello.com/)

- [Citation Management](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/research/scholarly/citation-management.html): There are a few different programs, here is a guide to help you decide. Reddit also has some useful threads on the trade-offs between each. 

- [Dataquest](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html): NU offers access to the coursework to a limited number of people on a quarterly basis, just make sure that you get registered in time!
